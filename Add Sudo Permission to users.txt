Prerequisites

    A system running CentOS 7
    Access to a user account with root privileges
1.If you’re working on a local machine, log in to the system with administrator credentials

	[root@node1 home]#

2.Create a New Sudo User

To add a new sudo user, open the terminal window and enter the command:

	[root@node1 home]# useradd prudvi
	set the passwd to the user
	[root@node1 home]# passwd prudvi

3. Verify the Wheel Group is Enabled

	Your CentOS 7 installation may or may not have the wheel group enabled.

	Open the configuration file by entering the command:

	[root@node1 home]#visudo

	Scroll through the configuration file until you see the following entry:

	## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands

	# %wheel        ALL=(ALL)       ALL

	if the second line begins with the # sign, it has been disabled and marked as a comment. Just delete the # sign at the beginning of the 
                second line so it looks like the following:

	%wheel        ALL=(ALL)       ALL

	Then save the file and exit the editor.

4. Add User to Group
	The easiest way to grant sudo privileges to a user on CentOS is to add the user to the “wheel” group. 
	Members of this group are able to run all commands via sudo and prompted to authenticate themselves with their password when using 		               sudo

	To add a user to the wheel group, use the command:

	[root@node1 home]#usermod -aG <groupname> <username>

	[root@node1 home]#usermod –aG wheel prudvi

5. Switch to the Sudo User
	
	[root@node1 home]#su - prudvi



6. To test the sudo access, run the whoami command:

sudo whoami

You will be prompted to enter the password. If the user have sudo access, the command will print “root”:

root
