Shell Scripts are used in UNIX/LINUX OS to ease/automate your tasks/jobs.

It’s the most efficient shell scripting language. It gives you the easiest way to automate things if you are already familiar with using a shell interactively. If you’re programming systems then you should know how the shell works anyway.

To save yourself from making disasters and save your precious time. If you need to do certain jobs repetitively, create a script to simplify your jobs, this way it will be harder for you to accidentally make a mess. First you create a script and then you automate it. Learning shell script is a worthy investment. Just make sure you also create a good documentation out of it.

What is the difference between while and for loop in shell script?
difference between for loop and while loop is that in for loop the number of iterations to be done is already known and is used to obtain a certain result whereas in while loop the command runs until a certain condition is reached and the statement is proved to be false.
