 What is Operating System?

It is an interface between user and the hardware

As the hardware understands only binaries(1,0) and user can understand human readable language

OS converts the human readable to binaries and binaries to human readable to have a perfect communication between both.
The purpose of an OS is to function as a sort of foundation for other software to run within.  If the OS were not running on a computer, none of the other software would work.

Over the many years of computing, there have been several Operating Systems available, but many people are only familiar with one or two – usually Windows ,when using desktop computers.  In the server world, there is currently another OS which you are more likely to find running, and that OS is Linux, widely accepted OS globally.

Linux accounts for a huge share of the server Operating System market





 Client Operating System:Windows10,Windows7,WindowsXP, Windows11
		         Ubuntu Desktop
		         eg: MSOffice2003

 ServerOperating System: RHEL7,Suse,BSD,Ubuntu,Unix
		          Windows2016,Windows2012, Windows2008/R2

Why many people were using Linux Operating System only for deploy and running Applications?
	Linux= Security,Stable, Consistent Performance

Types of Operating System:

 Single user 	----	Single Task	--ex:- DoS 
 Single user	----	Multi Task	-- Windows
 Multiuser		----	Multitask		-- UNIX, Linux

  
 Unix History
 ---------------
 [Source Code + Application]
 
       Kernel + Application    ->O/s  -> 1969, AT& T Labs, Unix

  FSF  = Free Software Foundation
	Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, 	              			copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software
  GNU = Generally Not Unix
	The GNU project was created to produce a free software alternative to Unix.
	Its goal is to give computer users freedom and control in their use of their computers and computing devices by collaboratively developing and 
                publishing software that gives everyone the rights to freely run the software, copy and distribute it, study it, and modify it. GNU software grants these rights                    in its license.

 1984 --- HP      	  ----- HP-UX
 1984 ---Apple  	  ----- MacOS
 1986 ---IBM              ----- AIX
 1991 ---Sun/Oracle ----- SunSolaris

 Note: The above all operating systems are Hardware dependent i.e these Os will work only on the relevant hardware, but 
            it will not support other software & hardwares



   FSF---GNU
     1991 --- Helsinky University during summer holidays,  Linus Torvalds has developed the linux i.e [GNU Kernel + Software]


  Later other Linux Distributions introduced in the market are:
	Novell  ----Suse
	REDHAT --- RHL/RHEL,Centos
	OEL, Fedora,Debian,Mint,Puppy,Kali*, BoSS,PowerLinux,Ubuntu
==============================================================
Linux:

Linux is an open-source operating system (OS). It was initially designed to be similar to UNIX but gradually evolved to run on various hardware from phones to supercomputers.


Linux is widely adopted by many organization across the world , because of the following:

    It is a free and open-source operating system.
    It is secure.
    It is flexible.
    It supports almost all the programming languages.


Features of Linux
--------------------

Portable =    Portability means software's can works on different types of hardware in same way. 
                   Linux kernel and application programs supports their installation of any kind of hardware 
                   platform.
Opensource= Linux source code is freely available and it is community based development project.

Multi-user= Linux is a multiuser system means multiple users can access system resources.

Multiprogramming=Linux is a multiprogramming system means multiple applications can run at same 
                                    time.

SHELL = Linux provides a special interpreter program which can be used to execute commands of the 
           operating system.
           SHELL gathers input from the user and executes programs.
           When a program finishes executing, it displays that program's output.
	

Security=Linux provides user security using authentication features like password protection/controlled
                access to specified files/encryption of data.


 Why we use Linux?
	- Open Source
	- Most of the software's are freely available

 Where we can use Linux?

	- Linux is mostly used in portable devices.
	- Home Automation
	- Artificial Intelligence
	- Machine Learning
	- Penetration Testing (web applications..security testing..cyber attacks)
	- Developing New Software's and Tools
