Jenkins Pipeline Process- Documentation
______________
Delivery Pipeline 

 Pipeline is a group of events or jobs which are interlinked with one another in a sequence. In simple words, 
 Jenkins Pipeline is a combination of plugins that support the integration and implementation of continuous delivery pipelines using Jenkins.

	-A Continuous Delivery pipeline is a set of steps your code changes will go through to make their way to  production. 
	-A Continuous Delivery pipeline delivers, as per requirements, quality products frequently and predictably from testingphase=>staging => production in an 		  automated fashion.

2: Create 3 new jobs
	2.1 BuildJob
	2.2 Deploy Job
	2.3 TestJob

3:  Build the jobs individually and check the console output. 
	-After that , need to trigger the job

4:  To show the demo of the jobs builds, need to open three jobs in 3 different windows
       - Add upstream /downstream jobs

5: First configure SampleDeployJob,
	Under the Build Triggers-> check/select Build after other projects are builld
	  projects to watch = Buildjob

	
6: Like the above go to SampleTestJob
	Under the Build Triggers-> check/select Build after other projects are builld
	  projects to watch = DeployJob

7: Now run the Samplebuildjob,once it is successfully builds check the 
	other window "deployjob", it automatically builds once "buildjob" completed
	same way "testjob" also builds once "deployjob" completed.

1. Installing Delivery Jenkins Pipeline
	-Other one is , ManageJenkins->Manage Plug-ins
	-Download from internet and upload in jenkins(one method)
	

2: Add 
	Delivery Pipeline View 
	configure the view
	-Go to dashboard and press "+" and select "Delivery Pipeline view" radio button
	- give the view name in the box " TestDeliveryPipelineView"
 Under Pipelines  ->Components
	- Add components by giving intial job "samplebuildjob"
	- once we apply, it displays the view of the pipeline
	- if we are not build any jobs then this view will show empty values
	- EditView->
		-Number of pipeline instances per pipeline =3
		- if select "Enable start of new pipeline build", then in pipeline view, "Buildjob" button is visible.(Save and check now)
		- if select "Enable rebuild" then on every job, there is refresh button is visible, 
		   so we  can rebuild the job if requires.(Save and check now)
		- select 
			"Show commit messages"
			"Show total build time"
		select the theme "contrast"
		

Step 4 Run and Validate

how to setup build pipelines in jenkins?

BUILD PIPELINE in Jenkins 

1. As we have already created the following jobs
	-BuildJob
	-DeployJob
	-TestJob
	- These jobs are chained already

2. Now, Install the "BuildPipeline Plugin" in jenkins
     Manage Jenkins-> Manage Plugins->Available section-> search "Build Pipeline" , install and restart jenkins

3. Now, Adding the Build Pipeline View and configure 
	- Go to Dashboard and click on "+"
	-  name="BuildPipelineTestView"
     EditView/Configure
	- Display Options<give any number>=3
     	(with this you can able to view the last 3 builds of jenkins job)
	- to view the console output in new window
	Console Output Link Style= "New Window"
