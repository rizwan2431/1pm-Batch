Search for a string “linux” in a file using  grep command in unix

This is the basic usage of grep command. It searches for the given string in the specified file.

	#grep “linux” index.html

Insensitive case search with grep -i

The below grep command searches for the words like “LINUX”, “Linux”, “linux” case insensitively.

	#grep -i “linux” index.html

Searching for a string in multiple files.

This command will search for "linux" string in multiple files at a time. It searches in all files with file1.txt, file2.txt and along with different extensions too like file1.html, file2.php and so on.

	#grep “linux” file*.*

Specifying the search string as a regular expression pattern.

It is a very powerful feature and can use as a regular expression with much effectively. 
it searches for all the pattern that starts with “fast” and ends with “host” with anything in-between. i.e 
To search “fast[anything in-between]host” in index.html file.

	#grep “fast.*host” index.html



Displaying the line numbers.

You can use this grep command to display the line number which contains the matched string in a file using the -n option

	#grep -n “word*” file.txt

6. Print the line excluding the pattern using -v option

List all the lines of the file /etc/passwd that does not contain specific word “string”.

	#grep -v linux /etc/passwd


7. If a directory is given as an argument, files and directories in that directory are shown.

$ ls /usr
bin games include lib lib64 local sbin share src


Linux process commands
------------------------------

 1. to display hidden files
	[root@localhost admin]# ls -la
2.tree
   Show files and directories in a tree starting from root
	[root@localhost admin]# tree

3. top 
top command gives you information on the processes that currently exist.
	[root@localhost admin]# top
4. htop(ubuntu)
	It  is similar to top, but allows you to scroll vertically and
       horizontally, so you can see all the processes running on  the
       system,  along with their full command lines, as well as view-ing them as a process tree, selecting multiple  processes  and
       acting on them all at once.
	(Note: it works only in few distributions of linux)
	[root@localhost admin]# htop


5.ps
   Use the ps command to list running processes (top and htop list all processes whether active or inactive).
	[root@localhost admin]# ps


6.kill
              As its name suggests, kill can be used to terminate a process with extreme prejudice.
	[root@localhost admin]# kill -9 <processid>
	[root@localhost admin]# kill -9 3648

		

=============================================================

nslookup

A network utility program used to obtain information about Internet servers. 
As its name suggests, the utility finds name server information for domains by querying DNS.
Nslookup (stands for “Name Server Lookup”) is a useful command for getting information from DNS server. It is a network administration tool for querying the Domain Name System (DNS) to obtain domain name or IP address mapping or any other specific DNS record. It is also used to troubleshoot DNS related problems.

 [root@localhost home]# nslookup www.google.com

==================================================
 Network commands

1.PING 
	PING(Packet Internet Groper) command sends packet requests to the address you specify to test the connectivity between 2 nodes
	ping IP/hostname
	[root@localhost admin]# ping www.google.com


2.ifconfig
	Ifconfig  utility is used to configure network interface parameters. 
  	Mostly we use this command to check the IP address assigned to the system
	
	[root@localhost admin]#ifconfig -a


3.route
	route command is the tool used to display routeing table

	[root@localhost admin]# route
4. ssh
    Connect to host as user

[root@localhost admin]# ssh myuser4@localhost

5. 
	The w command lists the currently logged in users.
	[root@localhost classroom]# w

6. uname

You can obtain some system information regarding the Linux computer you’re working on with the uname command.

    Use the -a (all) option to see everything.
    Use the -s (kernel name) option to see the type of kernel.
    Use the -r (kernel release) option to see the kernel release.

[root@localhost classroom]# uname -s

8. history

      When you’ve been using Linux for a certain period of time, you’ll quickly notice that you can run hundreds of  commands every day. 
      As such, running history command is particularly useful if you want to review the commands you’ve entered before.

   [root@localhost classroom]# history

	To show the limited number of commands that executed previously as follows:
	[root@localhost classroom]# history 10	

9.  wget command

     this command is very much useful — you can even download files from the internet with the help of the 
    wget command. To do so, simply type wget followed by the download link.
	[root@localhost classroom]# wget <url>

	[root@localhost classroom]# wget https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-0.01.tar.gz

10.  ifconfig

	ifconfig is used to configure the kernel-resident network interfaces. 
	It is used at boot time to set up interfaces as necessary. 

	ifconfig(interface configuration) command is used to configure the kernel-resident network interfaces. 
	It is used at the boot time to set up the interfaces as necessary. After that, it is usually used when needed 	during debugging or when you need system tuning. Also, this command is used to assign the IP address 	and netmask to an interface or to enable or disable a given interface.

	[root@localhost ~]# ifconfig
	
	Display details of All interfaces including disabled interfaces using “-a” argument.
	[root@localhost ~]# ifconfig -a
	Display a short list, instead of details.
	[root@localhost ~]# ifconfig -s
	

11. netstat
	netstat command displays various network related information such as network connections, 
	routing tables, interface statistics, multicast memberships etc..,
	
	[root@localhost ~]# netstat 
	
	 To list out all the TCP port numbers

		[root@localhost ~]# netstat -at
	
12. View files more or less
	commands such as ps, you know that file listings can be long, and a lot of the information flows right off the screen. Sure, you can page up or scroll, but 	
                it's not very efficient.
	The commands more and less limit the amount of data you see to one "page." 
	
	[root@localhost ~]#more /etc/passwd

	[root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/passwd | more

	[root@localhost ~]#ps -ef | more

	[root@localhost ~]# less /etc/passwd

	[root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/passwd | less

	[root@localhost ~]# ps -ef | less

13. sed

         - Sed is a text-editor that can perform editing operations in a non-interactive way. 
         - The sed command gets its input from standard input or a file to perform the editing operation on a file. 	
         - Sed is a very powerful utility and you can do a lot of file manipulations using sed.
	To replace a text in a file by searching it in a file, you can use the sed command with a substitute “s” flag to search for the specific pattern and 	change it.

	[root@localhost classroom]# sed 's/supercomputers/supersystems/g' linux.txt

14. free
	free command which displays the total amount of free space available along with the amount of memory used and swap memory in the 				system, and also the buffers used by the kernel.

	[root@localhost classroom]# free

		     total        used        free           shared  buff/cache   available
	Mem:           953Mi       140Mi       554Mi       2.0Mi       258Mi       669Mi
	Swap:             0B          0B          0B



	When no option is used then free command produces the columnar output as shown above where column:

    	total = displays the total installed memory (MemTotal and SwapTotal e present in /proc/meminfo).
      	 used= displays the used memory.
    	free  = displays the unused memory.
    	shared= displays the memory used by tmpfs
    	buffers= displays the memory used by kernel buffers.
    	cache= displays the memory used by the page cache and slabs
    	
	Options for free command

    		-b, – -bytes :It displays the memory in bytes.
   		 -k, – -kilo :It displays the amount of memory in kilobytes(default).
    		-m, – -mega :It displays the amount of memory in megabytes.
   		 -g, – -giga :It displays the amount of memory in gigabytes

	[root@localhost classroom]# free -m


15. gzip
	The gzip is a useful command when it comes to file management. 
	It is a file compressing tool with its primary goal is to reduce file size. 
	The gzip command by default deletes the original file and saves only the new compressed file 
	which is resulted from the command.

	[root@localhost classroom]# gzip linux.txt

	Unzipping gz File

	On Linux and macOS, you can decompress a .gz file using the gzip utility. 
	[root@localhost classroom]# gzip -d linux.txt.gz
