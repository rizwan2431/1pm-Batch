
download the vagrant software
https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html




To install vagrant we need 3 things
1. vagrant software
2. Oracle Virtual Box
    https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
3. SSH(for ssh we can use putty but cmder also can be used )
    http://cmder.net/

   or
https://cmder.en.softonic.com/

Step1: Open vagrantup.com to download the software
	https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
	-Download the relevant OS based software(vagrant)
	-Download the VirtualBox software and install it
	   https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
	-Downlod the ssh ie cmder and install
	http://cmder.net/

Step2: After installation of vagrant s/w and cmder and virtual box

Step3: click on cmder.exe file
	To know the version of vagrant installation
	- C:\Users\India
		? vagrant -v



Step4: create a folder ubuntu in the location c:\users\india\vagrant\ubuntu
	-? cd C:\Users\India\Vagrant\ubuntu


Step4.1: open browser and http://www.vagrantup.com-> findboxes-> click the ubuntu virtual box

 or

https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search

Step5: go to commandline prompt
	$users\india\vagrant\ubuntu\ vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty64
(this is for first time..., if you want to login for the next time this command is not required)

Step6: vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64
 (this will create the vagrant file in the ubuntu folder)

Step7: vagrant up , press enter

STep8: vagrant ssh

	Welcome to Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.13.0-144-generic x86_64)

 	* Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com/

 	System information disabled due to load higher than 1.0

  	Get cloud support with Ubuntu Advantage Cloud Guest:
    	http://www.ubuntu.com/business/services/cloud

	packages can be updated.
 	updates are security updates.

	New release '16.04.4 LTS' available.
	Run 'do-release-upgrade' to upgrade to it.

    (OR)

Step8.1 : vagrant ssh

(Sometimes, ssh not connecting to your VM box so, manually we need to connect for that you need to follow the steps below)
try the following command:
C:\Users\India\Vagrant\ubuntu>vagrant ssh-config

	Host default	
	HostName 127.0.0.1
  	User vagrant
 	 Port 2222
  	man/dev/null
  	StrictHostKeyChecking no
  	PasswordAuthentication no
 	 IdentityFile C:/Users/India/Vagrant/ubuntu/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key
  	IdentitiesOnly yes
  	LogLevel FATAL

Manually connect to the vm machine

ssh vagrant@127.0.0.1 -p 2222 -i<copy the privatekey path> and press enter




Step9: vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$
it means now you are in virutal box of ubuntu
_______________________________________________________


- Now you can install vagrant in virtual box of ubuntu
Before that, first you need to login as a root

vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ sudo -i
(with this command ubuntu machine login as root)

-$sudo apt-get install git
-


1. To check the status of the machine go to the machine folder(i.e ubuntu)
     	C:\Users\India\Vagrant\ubuntu>$vagrant status
2. To stop the running machine
	C:\Users\India\Vagrant\ubuntu>$ vagrant halt
3. To destroy the machine
	C:\Users\India\Vagrant\ubuntu>$ vagrant destroy



if you click the oracle virtual box it, will ask the username/password
vagrant/vagrant
