
 Create 2 users and place these 2 users under the same group.
 Create one sharedFolder for the project, where these two users can access the files.


1. create two users
	[root@localhost home]# useradd teamuser1
	[root@localhost home]# passwd teamuser1
         another user
  	[root@localhost home]# sudo useradd teamuser2
	[root@localhost home]# passwd teamuser2

2.  creating common group using groupadd command
	[root@localhost home]# groupadd telecom-project
	[root@localhost home]#ls -l

3.  create shared directory and change group for it using chgrp command.
	[root@localhost home]# mkdir /home/sharedRepo
	[root@localhost home]# sudo chgrp <groupname> /home/sharedRepo
	[root@localhost home]# sudo chgrp telecom-project /home/sharedRepo

4. After this we need to change appropriate permissions for the shared directory using chmod command. 
	[root@localhost home]# chmod 770 /home/sharedRepo/
	Here 770 permission means:

	7 – owner has rwx permissions.
	7 – directory groups have rwx permissions.
	0 – others have no permissions.

5. We also need to set the SGID(Set-Group-ID) bit for the sharedFolder directory, now all newly created subdirectories/files under sharedFolder will inherit sharedFolder permissions. 
	[root@localhost home]# chmod +s /home/sharedRepo/

6.we add users to the common group with whom to share the folder 
			syntax: usermod -a -G <secondarygroupname> <username>

	[root@localhost home]# usermod -a -G telecom-project teamuser1
	[root@localhost home]# usermod -a -G telecom-project teamuser2

7.Now /home/sharedFolder is accessible to both the users, but other users can't access these sharedFolder.
