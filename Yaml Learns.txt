Ansible uses YAML syntax for expressing Ansible playbooks.

 YAML stands for "YAML Ain't markup language" is a data serialization language which is intended to be human – friendly

 YAML is case sensitive
 	-The files should have .yaml/.yml as the extension
 	-YAML does not allow the use of tabs while creating YAML files; spaces are allowed instead
 	-Every YAML file optionally starts with “---” and ends with “...”
 	-Ansible uses YAML because it is very easy for humans to understand, read and write when compared to other data  formats 
	 like XML and JSON.
 	-YAML uses simple key-value pair to represent the data.

 What is YAML used for?
	- It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted.
	- yaml is a scripting lanaguage, means we can communicate with other languages using yaml.
	- Other languages means, it may be OS, any applications or services running on OS


For Ansible, nearly every YAML file starts with a list.

Each item in the list is a list of key/value pairs, commonly called a “hash” or a “dictionary”. So, we need to know how to write lists and dictionaries in YAML.
All YAML files (regardless of their association with Ansible or not) can optionally begin with --- and end with ... This is part of the YAML format and indicates the start and end of a document.


DataTypes:
------------
1. There are different types of keys or data types, based on which type of data we are storing a key

	my_integer: 50
	employee  id: 123456 (key with space)
	my_string: "yaml scripting"
	my_string: yaml scripting
 	test float: 69.123
	test boolean: true
	null value: null

      

Playbook consists of following sections:

1. Host declaration
	- defines that on which server groups playbook should run based on the ansible inventory file
2. Variable declaration(Optional)(vars)
	- declaration of variable in playbook. 
3. Action / Tasks Declaration
	- every tasks should have a name which will show you in the output while running the playbook and also its easy 
	  for us to identify it.
	install httpd
	update httpd
4. become
	- to tell ansible this playbook has to be executed with  elevated privileges
5. become_user
	- username , that we want to switch to the root or sudo user, need to be get executed the playbook in your host machines
