Agile Software Development

1.Agile means flexible and responsive. 
  So, agile project management is a project management approach that is responsive to the needs of customers. 
  The flexibility of agile helps in addressing specific issues in contemporary software development.

2. The most prominent issues in this regard emerge in the form of falling behind schedule or exceeding the project budget. 
   However, agile software development addresses noticeable setbacks that accompany conventional software development 
   approaches. 
   The conventional software development approaches include waterfall, iterative, or spiral project management approaches. 
   These approaches need a comprehensive awareness of the application domain as well as the actual requirements of the client.

3. On the other hand, the comprehensive awareness of specific application domain is very rare. 
   Also, customers generally request for changes in the course of the development process. 
   So, uncertainty and irreversibility are common traits in software development. 
   Agile development tries to address these two issues with the facility of support for changes in the development process.

4. Agile software development refers to  software development methodologies centered round the idea of iterative development, 
   where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams. 
   
  The ultimate value in Agile development is that it enables teams to deliver value faster, with greater quality and 
  predictablity, and greater aptitude torespond to change. Scrum and Kanban are two of the most widely used 
  Agile methodologies
