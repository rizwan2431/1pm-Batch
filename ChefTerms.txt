Cookbook is the basic building block of chef configuration management tool. 
-A cookbook contains the complete set of resources required to configure an application or certain thing 
  on a node(a node is a server that has chef agent running, which will pull configurations applicable from 
  chef server). 

-chef agent executes the resources on the node in the same order it is defined in the cookbook.


Recipes:
---------

 It is the directory where most of us will be working. 
 This directory holds all the steps that needs to be executed on the nodes to configure it the required way. 
 By default there will be a default.rb file inside this directory, which can be used to define our resources.

- Recipe is a collection of resources. Resources are nothing but Ruby code blocks that defines a particular step that   needs to happen on the node.

syntax of a resource looks like the below..

	type "name" do
   		 attribute "value"
    		action :type_of_action
	end
