 Ansible
	
	Ansible. An open-source product created by Red Hat,
	Ansible is a popular platform used to automate repetitive IT processes and manage configurations across an IT infrastructure.
	Ansible replaces time-consuming and error-prone manual processes for tasks like cloud provisioning, configuration management, and application 			deployment, making it a staple for today’s system administrators and DevOps professionals.
	Ansible uses a push-based configuration that automatically sends pre-written configuration files (which Ansible calls playbooks) from the Ansible server 			 (host) to the target machine (the node).

	Ansible is an open source IT configuration management and automation platform. 
	It uses human-readable YAML templates so users can program repetitive tasks to happen automatically without having to learn an 					advanced programming language.
	-Ansible is agentless, which means the nodes it manages do not require any software to be installed on them
	-Ansible is a configuration management tool that is designed to automate controlling servers for administrators and operations teams. 
               -With Ansible you can use a single central server to control and configure many different remote systems using SSH and Python as only               	  		requirements.
	- It is simple IT automation engine that automates provisioning, configuration, application deployment,intra-service orchestration and many 	                   		  other IT needs.
	-Ansible is an agentless automation tool that by default manages machines over the SSH protocol.
	- Once installed, Ansible does not add a database, and there will be no daemons to start or keep running.


Features
	-Opensource
	-Written in Python, so its easy to read.
	-Easy installation and configuration
	-Highly Scalable
	-Agent less client configuration

Requirements:
	-SSH client
	-Python(yaml)
   	-Playbooks(yaml scripting)



Is Ansible written in Python?

Ansible itself is written in Python and has a fairly minimal learning curve. Ansible follows a simple setup procedure and does not depend on any additional software, servers or client daemons. It manages nodes over SSH and is parallel by default.

What is the difference between Docker and Ansible?

Ansible can manage full environments. With Ansible, you can manage not only the containers, but the environments around the containers. 
Docker instances still need to run on hosts, and those hosts need to be launched, configured, networked, and coordinated, whether they be local machines or full cloud infrastructures.



What is the use of Ansible in DevOps?

Ansible is an open source IT Configuration Management, Deployment & Orchestration tool. 

It aims to provide large productivity gains to a wide variety of automation challenges. 

This tool is very simple to use yet powerful enough to automate complex multi-tier IT application environment


Where we can use Ansible?

Ansible is an open-source automation tool, or platform, used for IT tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, intraservice orchestration, and provisioning





Is Ansible push or pull based?

Even though Ansible is “Push” based (Agentless) we have found that we have the option of using `ansible-pull` that can run locally on each instance and pull the latest Ansible code from a remote repo during boot time


What is Ansible architecture?

Ansible architecture. Ansible is a radically simple IT automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs.



What port does Ansible use?
Ansible change ssh port in playbook. In role de-servers-setup role the ssh port is changed from 22 to 8888, so when the last task is called it fails because it cannot connect to host through 22 port.
