Using Linux as your operating system allows you to easily provide access to many users simultaneously. However, that access also presents potential security risks. 

Understanding the variety and types of Linux file permissions for users and groups will ensure that your system is optimally secure.
To change directory permissions in Linux, use the following:

    chmod +rwx filename to add permissions
    chmod -rwx directoryname to remove permissions. 
    chmod +x filename to allow executable permissions.
    chmod -wx filename to take out write and executable permissions.

Note that “r” is for read, “w” is for write, and “x” is for execute.





There are three kinds of file permissions in Linux:

    Read (r): Allows a user or group to view a file.
    Write (w): Permits the user to write or modify a file or directory.
    Execute (x): A user or grup with execute permissions can execute a file or view a directory.  






	0  = No permission
	1  = execute
	2  = write
	3  = write, execute
	4  = read
	5  = read, execute	
	6  = read,write
	7  = read,write,execute



Access Modes are of three types:
---------------------------------------------

r = readonly

w = write/edit/delete/append

x = execute/run a command
