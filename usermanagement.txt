 User Management
-------------------
                $= usermode
	#= root /admin mode

 Important points related to users:
 --------------------------------------
	-Users and groups are used to control access to files and resources
	-Users login to the system by providing their username and password
	-Every file on the system is owned by a user and associated with a group
	-Every process has an owner and group affiliation and can only access the resources its owner or 
                 group can access.
	-Users cannot read,write or execute each other's files without permission.	

In Linux, user is one who uses the system
 users on a system are identified by a username and a userid.

Types of users are:

 1. Super user or root user
	- super user or the root user is the most powerful user. he is the administrator user.

 2. System user
	- System users are the users created by the software or applications. For example if we install Apache
                    it will created a user apache.
	    These kind of users are called system users.
 3. Normal user
	- Normal users are the users created by root user. They are normal users like Mike, rahul etc. 
                   Only the root users has the permission to create or remove the user.



 Whenever user is created in Linux things created by default are:
 ===================================
	- Home directory is created(/home/<username dir>)
	- A mail box is created (/var/spool/mail)
	- unique UID & GID are given to user(/etc/passwd)
	-with same username and private group also created in /etc/group

-  Whenever a user is created by default a private group is created with the same name.
    for example, if  abhishek user is created , by default  with the same name 'abhishek' a private group is created in (/etc/group)
-  RedHat Linux uses a user private group (UPG) scheme. 
-  Both users and groups use shadow passwords. Passwords are hashed and stored in different files,( /etc/shadow)


1.  by default username is in /home/username
2. The full account information is stored in the /etc/passwd file.
    [username]:[x]:[UID]:[GID]:[Comment]:[Home directory]:[Default shell]

eg: 
	vivek:x:1001:1001::/home/vivek:/bin/bash
	shyam:x:1001:1001::/home/shyam:/bin/bash

	vinay:x:1001:1001::/home/vinay:/bin/bash

   username = vivek
    x = account is protected by a shadowed password (in /etc/shadow), which is needed to logon as [username].
          Indicates that shadow passwords are used .
   [UID]= UID, these begin with 1000 and increment by 1 for each newly added user. UIDs below 1000 are reserved for system use.   
   GID = GID of the user’s primary group. These begin with 1000 and increment by 1 for each new group. 
            Users can belong to more than one group.            
[Home directory] = Home directory for this user 
[Default shell]= the shell that will be made available to this user when he or she login into the system.
=============================================================
 Creating a user
 -----------------
  syntax:
	#useradd <username> <options>
	 or 
	#adduser <options> <username>
	
Options are:
	 -u 	userid
	 -G	Secondary group id
	 -g 	primary group id
	 -d	home directory
	 -c 	comment
	 -s	shell

	
   Example:
	#useradd -u 1050 -c MGR -s /bin/bash myuser2


  Assigning the password to the user
  --------------------------------------
    #passwd <username>
     # passwd myuser3


To display password status information of a user , use -S option in passwd command.

[root@localhost ~]# passwd -S <username>
[root@localhost ~]# passwd -S advith


advith PS 2020-05-20 0 99999 7 -1 (Password set, MD5 crypt.)


username=advith
PS=password status
	(PS=Password Set,LK=Password locked, NP=No Password)
2020-05-20 = when the password was changed
0=minimum age
99999 =maximum age
 7=warning period
-1=inactivity period for the password





Removing Password of a User using -d option
[root@localhost ~]# passwd -d <username>
[root@localhost ~]# passwd -d advith
Removing password for user advith.
passwd: Success


[root@localhost ~]# passwd -S <username>
[root@localhost ~]# passwd -S advith
advith NP 2020-05-20 0 99999 7 -1 (Empty password.)

Set Password Expiry Immediately
Use ‘-e’ option in passwd command to expire user’s password immediately , this will force the user to change the password in the next login.

[root@localhost ~]# passwd -e <username>
[root@localhost ~]# passwd -e advith
Expiring password for user advith.
passwd: Success


Set Minimum Days to Change Password using -n option
<username> user has to change the password in 90 days. A value of zero shows that user can change it’s password in any time.

[root@localhost ~]# passwd -n 15 <username>
[root@localhost ~]# passwd -n 15 advith
Adjusting aging data for user advith.
passwd: Success
[root@localhost ~]# passwd -S advith
advith PS 2020-05-20 15 99999 7 -1 (Password set, MD5 crypt.)


Set Warning days before password expire using -w option

[root@localhost ~]# passwd -w 10 <username>
[root@localhost ~]# passwd -w 10 advith
Adjusting aging data for user advith.
passwd: Success
[root@localhost ~]# passwd -S advith
advith PS 2020-05-20 15 99999 10 -1 (Password set, MD5 crypt.)





   Deleting a user
   ----------------
 #userdel <username>

to delete the user with its home directory and mailbox use
#userdel -r <username> 
#userdel -r myuser2




==============================================
To Check the Encrypted or Shadow password of users
=================================

[root@localhost admin]# cat /etc/shadow | grep myuser2
myuser2:$1$DHxO9Lxz$blsGq4RUTF1DUvQZFkPqg0:18107:0:99999:7:::

 ==============================================
Modifying the user's attribute

  After creating a user if we need to modify the attributes of users like changing uid,secondary group id or adding a comment , locking or unlocking

 syntax: # usermod <options> <username>
 Options are:
      -l 	to change login name
      -L 	to LOCK account
      -U 	to UNLOCK account

 ex:
    #usermod  -l newname oldname

    # usermod -L <username>
    # usermod -U <username>

 Note: When an account is locked it will show !(Exclamation mark) in /etc/shadow file.
 account lock/unlock details can also be checked by "#passwd -S <username>" command

-------------------------------------------------
Send the mail from one logged in user to the other user in linux
 Open two tabs for the two users

 Step1:
	 Logged in user
	[root@localhost classroom]# mail -s testmail testuser
	Hi 
		This is user admin 
		sending an test mail to you.
	(ctrl+d)

Step2:
	(Other user)
	to check the mail box
	[testuser@localhost classroom]$ mail

	Heirloom Mail version 12.5 7/5/10.  Type ? for help.
	"/var/mail/testuser": 1 message 1 new
