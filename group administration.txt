 Group Administration


The main purpose of the groups is to define a set of privileges like read, write, or execute permission for a given resource that can be shared among the users within the group

In Linux there are two types of group; 
	primary group and secondary group.
	Primary group is also known as private group. 
	Primary group is compulsory. Every user must be a member of a primary group and there can be only one primary group for each user/member.


	
	- Linux uses groups as a way to organize users. 
 	- users are assigned to groups with unique group ID numbers (GID)
	- The group name and GID are stored in /etc/group
	- Each user is given their own private group
	- All users in a group can share files that belong to the group.	
	- Each user is a member of at least one group called a primary/private group.
