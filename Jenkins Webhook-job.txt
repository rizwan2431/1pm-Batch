
Lets get understand what is meant by webhook ,

-Webhooks allow you to build or set up integrations, such as GitHub Apps or OAuth Apps, which subscribe to certain events on GitHub.com. 
-When one of those events is triggered, we'll send a HTTP POST payload to the webhook's configured URL. 
-Webhooks can be installed on an organization, a specific repository, or a GitHub App. Once installed, the webhook will be sent each time one or more   subscribed events occurs.
-Can create up to 20 webhooks for each event on each installation target (specific organization or specific repository).
-When configuring a webhook, you can use the UI or API to choose which events will send you payloads. 
-A webhook is an HTTP callback, an HTTP POST that occurs when something happens through a simple event-notification via HTTP POST.
-GitHub webhooks in Jenkins are used to trigger the build whenever a developer commits something to the master/main branch.



1. Freestyle project

2. 
https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup

xxxxxxxx

3. download the ngrok software for windows10
(ngrok allows you to expose a web server running on your local machine to the internet.
If you don't know what port your web server is listening on, it's probably port 80, the default for HTTP.)

Ngrok is a reverse proxy that allows traffic to be redirected from the generated url to wherever your local server is running.



4. extract the ngrok folder and check the version

C:\Users\India\Downloads\Programs>ngrok --version

5. expose the http 8080 port in this path, which will point to our Jenkins server.
	You will receive your proxy hostname after running that command 
C:\Users\India\Downloads\Programs>ngrok http 8080
